# Detection-Demo
This project is a work-in-progress AI-based student behavior recognition system aimed at improving academic assessment integrity. 
It uses MediaPipe for head pose and gaze estimation, and YOLOv8 for real-time facial tracking. 
The system is designed to monitor students' head movement and eye direction during tests to help identify potentially dishonest behavior, such as frequently looking away from the screen or breaking focus.
Built with Python, the system combines OpenCV for video processing, MediaPipe for real-time landmark detection, and YOLOv8 for accurate detection of facial positioning. 
While the current version is in early development, the architecture is being tested on recorded sessions and configured for future deployment in controlled school environments.
The project is being developed as a potential pilot solution for the Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools (NIS) network, with the broader goal of creating scalable, open-source tools for smart proctoring and fairer testing environments in educational settings.
I hope they will accept the system and implement it.
